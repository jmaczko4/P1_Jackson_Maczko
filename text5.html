            <p>“I’ve learned that what we really want, beyond our tangible goals and pursuits, is to feel totally alive. We crave great experiences and meaningful relationships and we long to reach our full potential. We want to be challenged and creative. We want to grow. We want freedom to live with passion and pursue our dreams regardless of what people think, how much money we make, or what level of status we acquire. Ultimately, we want the best possible life—absolute fullness of life.” <br><br> “Five powerful ways to stay present in pressure situations: Get out of your head—and into your heart—and soul. Focus on your routines and only what you can control. Be grateful. Focus on a mantra. Ruthlessly eliminate hurry.” <br><br> “The purpose of your life should always be what’s guiding your life—in every single moment—not letting the ego push purpose aside for some temporary circumstance or event. If you want to live an extraordinary life, you cannot let other people’s words or actions take you out of your rhythm or flow.” <br>
